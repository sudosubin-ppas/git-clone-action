## Quick Start

```yml
```

## How does it work

This action clones a given git repository.

This project is aiming to replace [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) for non-GitHub repositories, while keeping the same `inputs` interface. (GitLab, Bitbucket, or Gitee)

## Usage

```yml
```
